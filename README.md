# IIT Bombay EE 230: Analog Lab Repository

Welcome to my repository for the 4th semester EE 230: Analog Lab course at IIT Bombay (Spring 2024). Whether you're a current student navigating the lab, a future student seeking guidance, or just curious about analog circuits, I hope you find something useful here!

## Contents:

- _Circuit Drawings (.eps files):_ All experimental circuit designs are created using XCircuit. Use them as starting points for your own projects! This is the [XCircuit download link](http://opencircuitdesign.com/xcircuit/download.html)
- _Circuit Simulations (.asc files):_ Simulations of the circuits are done in LTSpice. This is the [LTSpice download link](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html)

- _Problem Statements and Handwritten Reports (.pdf files):_ Original lab experiment handouts with full descriptions and objectives. and Handwritten Reports of the experiments I performed in Labs
- _Latex Reports (.tex files):_ Completed lab reports written in LaTeX. Use them as templates or inspiration, but replace the data and analysis with your findings.

_Note:_ This repository reflects my personal approach to the lab and may not cover all aspects of the course. Always prioritize the official course materials and instructions provided by your professors and lab instructors.

## How to Use:

- Explore the files and learn from my work.
- Fork this repository and use it as a starting point for your own projects.
