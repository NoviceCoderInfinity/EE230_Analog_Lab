        \label{fig:circuit1}
    \end{figure}
    
\subsubsection{Equations:}
    \begin{equation}
        {V_{in,cm(min)}} = V_{GS1} + V_{dsat3}
    \end{equation}
    
    \begin{equation}
        {V_{in,cm(min)}} = V_{TH1} + \sqrt{\frac{I_{tail}}{K_{n1}}} + \sqrt{2\cdot\frac{I_{tail}}{K_{n3}}}
    \end{equation}
    
    \begin{equation}
        A_v = gm1 \cdot R_2
    \end{equation}
    
    \begin{equation}
        A_v = \sqrt{I_{tail}\cdot {K_{n1}}} \cdot R_2
    \end{equation}
    
    \begin{equation}
        V_{out,cm} = V_{DD} - \frac{{I_{trail}}\cdot{R_2}}{2}
    \end{equation}

\subsection{Simulation Results:}
Using , Equation(1) we get, $I_{tail}$ = 0.845 mA. \\ \\
Using, $V_{in1}$ = $V_{in2}$ = 4.5V and $V_{dd}$ = 10V. \\
Let $A_v$ = 15dB = $20 \cdot\log_{10} ({    \frac{ V_{o,d} } { V_{in,d} } }) $ \newline \newline

\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!We get, $I_{tail}$ = 0.85mA. Let $I_{ref}$ = 1mA. \\
It can be seen from figure~\ref{fig:circuit1} that current through $M_4$ = 1mA, \\$V_{G4}$ = $V_{D4}$ = 1.94 + $V_{th,n} \approx 2.40V$. \\
Thus, $R_1$ = $\frac{V_{DD} - V_{D4}}{I_{ref}}$ = $\frac{10 V - 2.4 V}{1 mA}$ = $7.61l\Omega$ \\ \\

\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\! For current mirror circuit, $I_{tail}$ = $I_{ref}$ = 1mA. \\And in common mode, $I_{d1}$ = $I_{d2}$ = 0.5mA. Thus, $V_{S1}$ = $V_{D3}$ = 2.68V\\ \\ 

\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\! For $M_4$, $V_{DS3}$ - $V_{(GST)3}$ = 0.93V. Hence $M_4$ is in saturation. \\

\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\! From equation(3) and equation(4), we obtain, $R_2$ = 7.72 $k\Omega$ \\ 

\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\! From equation(5), $V_{D1}$ = $V_{D2}$ = 6.14V, satisfying, $5V < V_{out} < 7V$. \\

\subsubsection{Values Calculated From this Simulation Section:}
$R_1$ = 7.61k$\Omega$ and $R_2 = R_3 = 7.72k\Omega$ \hspace{1cm} $V_{out,cm}$ = $V_{d1}$ = $V_{d2}$ = 6.14V. \\ $I_{tail}$ = $I_{ref}$ = 1mA \hspace{1cm} $V_{D3}$ = $V_{S1} / 2$ = 2.68V\\
$M_1, M_2, M_3, M_4$, all are operating in saturation region.
